    <p className="aboutUsSectionText">TEDx is a student-led club which fosters an environment of sharing brilliant ideas that have the power to inspire growth. Our main events — Qissa, Come Connect, and the flagship TEDxShivNadarUniversity Conference — help us connect with others, ignite curiosity, and help build a community of people who value the weight of ideas.

    Every year, over 50 enthusiastic students work hard to make these events special. They take on different roles, from organizing event details to finding and inviting amazing speakers. Together, they put in the effort to create experiences that are memorable and exceptional for everyone involved.

    The TEDxShivNadarUniversity Conference is our biggest event, where we bring in a varied range of speakers and give them an illustrious stage. These speakers offer new ideas and spark thought-provoking conversations. 

  We invite you to be a part of this exciting journey. Our goal is to inspire new ways of thinking and make a positive difference in our community and beyond. Come join us in exploring new ideas and helping to ignite minds for a brighter future.
